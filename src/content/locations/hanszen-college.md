In 1957, Rice's second president William V. Houston initiated the college system. Hanszen College was created the same year along with Baker, Will Rice, and Wiess, with all four being male-only. The college took its name in honor of Harry Clay Hanszen, a Houston oil magnate and member of the Rice University Board of Governors from 1946-1950. An existing dorm called South Hall, along with a new dorm completed in 1957, became Hanszen's Old Section and New Section, respectively.
