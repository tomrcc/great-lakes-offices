If you take a little wander through South Campus, you’ll come across a college that shines like the pyre of a thousand phoenixes, illuminated by myth, power, and value. Congratulations, you are now a part of the rust and gold glory that is Will Rice College, the second college founded at Rice University! You may first notice that we have a dazzling outdoor quad flanked on three sides by our spectacular New Dorm, our stunningly historic Old Dorm, and the coziest commons on campus. It is inside, though, that you will truly get to experience the welcoming and warm spirit of your new Will Rice family.
